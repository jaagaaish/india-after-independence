               <p>India won freedom mainly through a sustained, non-violent struggle involving the sacrifice of thousands of people, mainly under the leadership of Tilak, Gandhi, Nehru and Bose. India became a free country on 15 August 1947.The Constitution guarantees fundamental rights to the citizens of India, ensuring equality, freedom and justice. </p>

                  <p>All citizens are equal and subject to the jurisdiction of the same authority. Even, the privy purses, granted to the princes and feudal lords, were abolished in the late sixties. Birth is no more the basis of recognising status and power. Religion, language, caste or ethnicity are no longer consider­ations for providing social honour and privileges.Equality before the law, also known as: equality under the law, equality in the eyes of the law, or legal equality, is the principle that each independent being must be treated equally by the law and that all are subject to the same laws of justice.Therefore, the law must guarantee that no individual nor group of individuals should be privileged or discriminated against by the government. Equality before the law is one of the basic principles of liberalism.This principle arises from various important and complex questions concerning equality, fairness, and justice. </p>

               <p>There has been tremendous progress in the field of education. More than 100 million children receive education at the primary level. The increase in numbers at the secondary stage is also impressive. Education at college and university levels has also increased enormously. Today, there are about 300 universities in India. Diver­sification of education at senior school, college and university levels has also been taken up by the Government of India.<br>Basic education is being provided at the elementary level. Today, at senior school and university levels, emphasis is being put on vocationalisation, computer studies, applied sciences, management and on some other relevant and gainful fields of knowledge to tackle the problem of unemployment among the educated young men and women.</p>

               <p>States of India were reorganised in 1955 on the basis of the recom­mendations made by the States Reorganisation Commission. Since this was done on the basis of the language spoken by the people, each state has some cultural cohesiveness.<br>India was characterised by the unique type of feudalism under which the rajas, thikanedars, jagirdars and zamindars were treated as Mai-Bap (parents). To begin with, the government abolished such patri­monial feudalism, and subsequently also abolished the privy purses and compensations granted to the rajas.<br>This was really a ‘revolu­tionary’ step as the tenants were granted ownership rights. The institution of zamindars as intermediaries was removed with the stroke of a pen. Later on, the consolidation of small landholdings and ceilings on maximum landholdings were taken up as measures of land reforms.</p>

               <p>In the field of industry as well, India has made a lot of progress since independence. Heavy industries at Hatia, Rourkela, Bokaro, Sindri, Bangalore and other places were established in the fifties and sixties. Small-scale and cottage industries have also received the attention of the government.<br>Industrialisation has been possible because India adopted the path of planned economic development and social change. The Planning Commission of India was assigned the task of planning. The government has adopted its policy of ‘mixed economy’, a policy of balanced growth of the private, the public, and the joint sectors.<br>The Community Development Programmes (CDPs) were started on 2 October 1952 for the uplift of the rural people. </p>
