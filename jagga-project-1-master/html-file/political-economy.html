               <p>After Independence the policymakers in India launched the project of economic development with a heavy involvement of the state and a democratic polity.<br>The economic development in India followed socialist-inspired policies in the early phase of its independent history. This included state-ownership of many sectors. As a result, in the first three decades after independence India’s per capita income increased at a rate of around 2.5 % annual rate.<br>This modest economic success, led to the foundation of a complex industrial economy and fairly reasonable rate of agricultural growth, with subsidized irrigation and chemical fertilizers.The objective of India’s development strategy has been to establish a socialistic pattern of society through economic growth with self-reliance, social justice and alleviation
                  of poverty. These objectives were to be achieved within a democratic political framework
                  using the mechanism of a mixed economy where both public and private sectors co-exist.
                  India initiated planning for national economic development with the establishment of the
                  Planning Commission.

            <p> The political elite in India launched a process of economic reform came with the launching of a policy of liberalization and privatization since 1990s. This was with a view to unleashing the entrepreneurial forces from the shackles of controls and regulations, hoping that some of the ensuing economic growth would trickle down to the clamoring masses.<br>The changes introduced, particularly since the early 90’s, were dramatic by past standards. The major elements of changes in policy over the de-licensing and deregulation of investment and production, discontinuation of exclusive reservation of many key industries, gradual abolition of quantitative restrictions on imports, movement towards a market-determined exchange rate, reduction of average levels of direct and indirect taxes and some streamlining and rationalization of the tax structure etc.<br>The flexible industrial licensing policy and a relaxed FDI policy started getting positive responses from international investors. Among the major factors that drove India's economic growth following the economic reforms were increased FDI, adoption of information technology and an increased domestic consumption.</p>

            <p>The politico economic transformation of the country continues to be pushed forward with third generation reforms. Third generation reforms deal with administrative and judicial reforms, labour market and FDI reforms. The center and state governments are working closely to make further progress.<br>Third generation reform is the bottom-up approach and not the trickle-down approach that was pursued in the first and second phase of reforms.<br>The emphasis is on the institution of Panchayati Raj that is made to play an interventionist kind of role to bring the fruits of growth to door steps of common man. The introduction of the Kisan Credit Card, micro-credit and encouragement of the Self Help Group movement has shown good results.<br>Moving further, cottage industry, small entrepreneurs, artisans, etc., are encouraged for skill development. They are being financially educated to develop the banking habit. Greater employment opportunities are created through institutional mechanism.
